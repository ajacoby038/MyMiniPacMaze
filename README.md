# MyMiniPacMaze
This is a game that I created with Android Studio for my Senior Seminar project

Features:
1. Pack-Man Maze start Splash screen
2. 1 Happy Pac-man
3. 15 ghosts moving horizontally or vertically with different speeds
4. 22 dots for Pac-man to eat
5. Many walls of the maze.
6. Four navigation arrows
7. "Game Over" Retry splash screen with gloomy sound
8. "Congratulations" Play Again splash screen with cheery fanfare sound

TODO:
1. Make multiple maze levels
2. Switch to auto-generating maze walls with complexity as a seed to some random generator algorithm
3. Improve multi-threading. Currently using CountDownTimers and MotionEvents, but there musth be a better way out there.
4. Code clean up - separate ghosts, dots, Pac-man, Maze floor ino their own files/classes
